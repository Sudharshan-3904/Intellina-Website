        <h2>Event Rules</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Team Size - 5 members</li>
            <li>The team leader's name should be announced in the form.</li>
            <li>Only the team leader can bid during the auction; other team members' bids are not considerable.</li>
            <li>Bidding will be conducted with the player's name, base price, country (e.g., Name: Virat Kohli, Base
                Price: 200L,
                Country: India ).</li>
            <li>
                Each team is required to select 6 players:
                <ol id="no-number-list">
                    <li>2 Batsmen</li>
                    <li>1 Wicket Keeper</li>
                    <li>1 All-Rounder</li>
                    <li>2 Bowler</li>

            </li>
            <li>A maximum of 2 foreign players can be playing.</li>
            <li>
                If a team successfully buys the maximum number of players in each category (role), subsequent bids for
                players in the same category will not be considerable. For example, if Team 1 has already bought 2
                batsmen, any further bids for batsmen from Team 1 will not be considered.
